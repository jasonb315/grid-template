# Project Name

All purpose grid template

**Author**: Jason Burns
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

One day in intermediate level classes the teacher said something like "if anyone can make me a grid template using what we've learned so far I'll give them extra credit", in a way that suggested he didn't expect anyone to be able to. I did it, and I was the only one, and it was a good day. These were the days before I knew about flex-box [pats self on back].

## Drid dynamics
Sections come in three sizes: full, half, and quarter.
div widths go into sections of any height, and are placed in sets of classes that == 100%,
which allows for a harmonious snap point based on media size.

## Use
Just clone the repo, and open index.html in the browser.
