# Project Name

All purpose grid template

**Author**: Jason Burns
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Grid dynamics
Sections come in three sizes: full, half, and quarter.
div widths go into sections of any height, and are placed in sets of classes that == 100%,
which allows for a harmonious snap point based on media size.

## Use
Clone the repo, and open index.html in any browser.
