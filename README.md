All purpose grid template

**Author**: Jason Burns
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

One day in intermediate level classes the teacher said something like "if anyone can make me a grid template using what we've learned so far I'll give them extra credit", in a way that suggested he didn't expect anyone to be able to. I turned this in during the next class.

module.css left for convienence.

## Drid dynamics
Sections come in three sizes: full, half, and quarter.
div widths do into sections of any height, and are placed in sets that == 100%
